<h4>Description </h4>
<p align="justify">
<br /> Social interaction is really an important way for a person to form character. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people faced difficulty getting out and socializing because of the restrictions that were implemented on common citizens. The existing software has limitations with the 2D environment, and people are easily getting bored with the audio and video calls, normal video games, etc. One of the reasons for this is the lower immersiveness of these applications. TouchVR connects people to a 3D virtual world in which they can completely immerse themselves in a more realistic experience. People can easily join their friends or colleagues even though they live in different parts of the world. Although TouchVR can be used for socializing, it can also be used to conduct professional meetings where different teams can connect and discuss the work they are currently doing. This could enhance team bonding which helps the members of the team to work actively. To enhance immersiveness, some of the features included are audio feedback and haptic feedback in TouchVR.

<h4>Additional Feature 1: Audio and haptic feedback </h4>
<p align="justify">
<br />Senses like touch, hearing, vision, smell, and taste play an important role in human lives, which helps people immerse themselves into their world. Hence, in any world, whether it is virtual or real, the feedback that activates these senses is crucial for humans to feel the environment. According to the studies, the human brain is moulded in such a way that it reacts to these senses. In TouchVR, these are included in the best possible way. For example, while clicking a button or selecting a 3D game object, the user could receive feedback in three different ways: haptic, sound, and vision. Visual feedback is included by default, and it can be done by highlighting the objects that are selected. But to provide more immersiveness, we can include haptics and audio, either any one feature individually or both the senses. In TouchVR, both haptic feedback and audio feedback are used in a flexible way, by using either of the two in one place. This approach has assisted in avoiding the overpowering of one particular feedback system.

<h4>Additional Feature 2: Instructions and labels </h4>
<p align="justify">
<br />Even in the real world, when we travel to new unfamiliar places for a visit or to stay there, it can be difficult to remember all of the routes that we need to commute, which is why direction boards with the names of the places are installed. Likewise, for a new user, it might be very difficult to understand a new environment in the virtual world if proper instructions are not given. Hence, in TouchVR, some basic instructions and labeling are included so that the user won't get lost in the world. The labeling is limited since it could stop the user from exploring the world. Aside from that, novice users of head-mounted displays are an important group to consider. And a small instruction on how to use the joysticks is also included.

<h4>Reflection on the virtual world and my mindset </h4>
<p align="justify">
<br />Working on this virtual world project was interesting for me. With confidence, I can say that I have learned a lot of things and I could implement what I learned. Even though my past work experience helped, there are certain challenges that I faced, and I have tried implementing some extra features. Apart, learned the basics of an unfamiliar multiplayer software development kit in the creation of the virtual world. There are a lot of other features that can be added to the TouchVR like creating a customized room. In nutshell, I made others test my application and took feedback and like me, everyone is really impressed with the end result. I am still exploring what could be done and want to add more features that I can in the future to further improve the application.
